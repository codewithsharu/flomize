# This workflow publishes the website to a CPanel server using FTP.
# To configure this workflow:
# 1. Go to your GitHub repository settings.
# 2. Click on 'Secrets and variables' -> 'Actions'.
# 3. Add the following repository secrets:
#    - FTP_SERVER: Your CPanel FTP server address (e.g., ftp.yourdomain.com).
#    - FTP_USERNAME: Your CPanel FTP username.
#    - FTP_PASSWORD: Your CPanel FTP password.
# 
# You can find these credentials in your CPanel dashboard:
# - Log in to your CPanel account.
# - Look for the "FTP Accounts" section to create or view existing FTP accounts.
# - The FTP server is usually your domain name with "ftp." prefix or your server's IP address.
# - Use the username and password associated with the FTP account you want to use.
# 
# To verify if the deployment was successful:
# - Check the GitHub Actions tab in your repository for the status of the workflow.
# - Look for any error messages in the logs of the FTP-Deploy-Action step.
# - Confirm that the files have been uploaded to your CPanel server by accessing your website.
# - You can also check the FTP logs in your CPanel for any connection issues or errors.
